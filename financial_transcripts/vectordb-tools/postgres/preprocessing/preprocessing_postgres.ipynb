       "[Document(page_content=\"Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call\\n\\nBrett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood\\n\\nTuesday, October 25, 2022\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: \\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel.\\n\\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \\n\\nOn this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a\\xa0substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\xa0They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\\xa0\\n\\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. \\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. \\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the \\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA:\\n\\nThank you, Brett.\\xa0\\n\\nTo start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times:\\xa0\\n\\nFirst, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world’s GDP will continue to increase.\\xa0\\n\\nSecond, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant currency.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.\\xa0\\n\\nMoving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today.\\xa0It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have.\\xa0\\n\\nWith Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services – including containerized applications – across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments.\\xa0\\n\\nWe now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago.\\xa0 We are the platform of choice for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud.\\xa0Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo Cars all run SAP on Azure.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for companies like\\xa0FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, with Azure Confidential Computing, we’re enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud.\\xa0\\n\\nJust last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its applications to Azure.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, to data and AI.\\xa0\\n\\nWith our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a\\xa0complete data fabric, helping customers cut “integration tax” associated with bringing together siloed solutions.\\xa0\\n\\nCustomers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data.\\xa0Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world’s\\xa0most-demanding workloads, at limitless scale.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nCosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure\\xa0the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and NoSQL workloads.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, in AI, we are turning the world’s most advanced models into platforms for customers.\\xa0\\n\\nEarlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E\\xa0to Azure OpenAI service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage,\\xa0and govern models.\\xa0\\n\\nAll-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four quarters in a row.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to developers.\\xa0\\n\\nWe have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And GitHub’s developer-first ethos has never been stronger.\\xa0More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times.\\xa0\\n\\nGitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into developers’ workflows.\\xa0\\n\\nToyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to Power Platform.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite, spanning low-code/no-code tools,\\xa0robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence.\\xa0\\n\\nPower BI is the market leader in business intelligence\\xa0in the cloud and is growing faster than competition,\\xa0as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPower Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a year ago.\\xa0\\n\\nPower Automate has over 7 million monthly active users,\\xa0and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re going further, with new AI-powered capabilities\\xa0in Power Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows.\\n\\nNow, on to Dynamics 365.\\xa0\\n\\nFrom customer experience and service, to finance and\\xa0supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve.\\xa0For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments.\\xa0\\n\\nCBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies.\\xa0Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants.\\xa0And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAll-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to industry solutions.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers.\\xa0Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their\\xa0environmental footprint.\\xa0\\n\\nNew updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon emissions.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution,\\xa0which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care.\\xa0\\n\\nPhysicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it’s quickly becoming an on-ramp\\xa0to our broader healthcare offerings.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to new systems of work.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today’s digitally connected, distributed world of work.\\xa0\\n\\nMicrosoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT.\\xa0\\n\\nThe new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content, as well as\\xa0personalized recommendations.\\xa0\\n\\nMicrosoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business.\\xa0\\n\\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users\\xa0we’ve gained and are seeing increased engagement too.\\xa0\\n\\nUsers interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.\\xa0\\n\\nIn a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail,\\xa0and the number of users who use four or more features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nTeams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly active enterprise users running third party\\xa0and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone.\\xa0\\n\\nTeams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by double-digits for five quarters in a row.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco’s devices and peripherals,\\xa0which will now run Teams natively.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re creating a new category with Microsoft Places\\xa0to help organizations evolve and manage their space\\xa0for hybrid and in-person work.\\xa0\\n\\nJust like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where.\\xa0\\n\\nWe also announced Teams Premium, addressing\\xa0enterprise demands for advanced meeting features,\\xa0like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAll this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365.\\xa0\\n\\nLeaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O’Lakes to Rabobank, continue to turn to our premium\\xa0\\xa0E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice,\\xa0and analytics.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ve also built a completely new suite with our\\xa0employee experience platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, we’re extending Viva to meet role-specific needs.\\xa0Viva Sales is helping salespeople at companies like\\xa0Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to Windows.\\xa0\\n\\nDespite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth.\\xa0\\n\\nAll-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active\\xa0Windows devices than pre-pandemic.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users\\xa0are spending 8.5 percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, we’re seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11.\\xa0\\n\\nAccenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11\\xa0to more than 450,000 employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L’Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to security.\\xa0\\n\\nSecurity continues to be a top priority for every organization.\\xa0\\n\\nWe are the only company with integrated,\\xa0end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance,\\xa0identity, and device management, and privacy across all clouds and platforms.\\xa0\\n\\nMore than 860,000 organizations across every industry –\\xa0\\xa0from BP and Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies – now use our security solutions, up 33 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThey can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security stack, and the number of customers\\xa0with more than 4 workloads have increased 50 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nMore organizations are choosing both our XDR and\\xa0\\xa0cloud-native SIEM to secure their entire digital estate.\\xa0\\n\\nThe number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd as threats become more sophisticated, we’re innovating to protect customers.\\xa0\\n\\nNew capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and manage security posture\\xa0across clouds.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premises and cloud-based user directories.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to LinkedIn.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWe once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth\\xa0 increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in the Unites States.\\xa0\\n\\nThere are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4X year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nNew integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning\\xa0help companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work.\\xa0\\n\\nMembers added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43 percent year over year.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon\\xa0be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform.\\xa0\\n\\nWe launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal size\\xa0by better understanding and evaluating customer interest.\\xa0\\n\\nFinally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading\\n\\ninnovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nMore broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketer or advertiser looking\\xa0to innovate.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ve expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X\\xa0over the past year.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by Windows.\\xa0\\n\\nEdge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon\\xa0and price comparison features to save money.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’ve surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets.\\xa0\\n\\nUsers of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more content, compared to a year ago.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re also expanding our third-party ad inventory.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNetflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan\\xa0next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel\\xa0media platform for retailers like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to gaming.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever\\xa0and whenever they want, on any device.\\xa0\\n\\nWe saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by\\xa0 strength off-console.\\xa0\\n\\nPC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year.\\xa0And with Cloud Gaming, we’re transforming how games are distributed, played, and viewed.\\xa0\\n\\nMore than 20 million people have used the service\\xa0to stream games to date.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech\\n\\nand Razer, as well as Meta Quest.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming, with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S.\\xa0\\n\\nNearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem.\\xa0\\n\\nIn closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization, while also focusing intensely\\xa0on our operational excellence and execution discipline.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that, I’ll hand it over to Amy.\\xa0\\n\\nAMY HOOD:\\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11 percent and 16 percent in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35 – and increased 4 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, when adjusted for the net tax benefit from the first quarter of fiscal year 22.\\n\\n\\n\\nDriven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations, even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken thru Q1. \\n\\nIn our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. \\n\\nAs you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, with growth of 31 percent in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3 percent and increased 16 percent in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution and we continued to see growth in the number of large, long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the 10-million-dollar-plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 31 percent and 34 percent in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23 percent year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38 percent year-over-year. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96 percent.\\n\\nFX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger US dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points. And at a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 6 points, and More Personal Computing revenue growth by 3 points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 3 points.\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 73 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs. \\n\\n\\n\\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 9 percent and 16 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69 percent. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier, and Nuance. \\n\\nOperating expense increased 15 percent and 18 percent in constant currency driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22 percent year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. \\n\\nOperating income increased 6 percent and 15 percent in constant currency. And operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance, and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow to our segment results.\\n\\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn. \\n\\nOffice commercial revenue grew 7 percent and 13 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11 percent and 17 percent in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance, and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14 percent year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings – although we saw continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. \\n\\nOffice consumer revenue grew 7 percent and 11 percent in constant currency driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 13 percent to 61.3 million. \\n\\n\\n\\nDynamics revenue grew 15 percent and 22 percent in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24 percent and 32 percent in constant currency. \\n\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 17 percent and 21 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11 percent and 18 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13 percent and 16 percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 10 percent and 19 percent in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate. \\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. \\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22 percent and 28 percent in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35 percent and 42 percent in constant currency, about a point lower than expected – driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads. \\n\\nIn our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 18 percent to over 232 million seats with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue was flat and increased 4 percent in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations – driven by hybrid demand including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. \\n\\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 5 percent and 10 percent in constant currency, driven by Enterprise Support Services. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross \\n\\n\\n\\nmargin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25 percent and 28 percent in constant currency, including roughly 8 points of impact from Nuance, and operating income grew 17 percent and 25 percent in constant currency, with roughly 9 points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate.\\n\\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion, and grew 3 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in Gaming consoles. \\n\\nWindows OEM revenue decreased 15 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20 percent driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. \\n\\nDevices revenue grew 2 percent and 8 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large HoloLens deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. \\n\\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex-TAC, increased 16 percent and 21 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefitting from an increase in search volumes and roughly 5 points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter.  \\n\\nAnd in Gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13 percent and 19 percent in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3 percent and increased 1 percent in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content, where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 9 percent and 4 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 5 points year-\\n\\n\\n\\nover-year driven by sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2 percent and 5 percent in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition, and operating income decreased 15 percent and 9 percent in constant currency.\\n\\nNow back to total company results.\\n\\nCapital expenditures including finance leases were $6.6 billion and cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals.\\n\\nCash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5 percent year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 FY22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2 percent and free cash flow was relatively unchanged year-over-year.\\n\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was $54 million driven by interest income which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. \\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19 percent.\\n\\nAnd finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\nNow, moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. \\n\\nMy commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year.\\n\\nFirst, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 7 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. \\n\\n\\n\\nOur outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and Search and news advertising revenue. \\n\\nIn our commercial business demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with consistent execution should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. \\n\\nIn commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base, against a strong prior year comparable which included a significant volume of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease \\n\\n\\n\\nroughly 2 points driven by lower Azure margin primarily due to higher energy costs, revenue mix shift to Azure, and the impact from Nuance. \\n\\nIn capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout.\\n\\nNext to segment guidance. \\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11 and 13 percent in constant currency or $16.6 to $16.9 billion US dollars.\\n\\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid 30s. \\n\\nIn Office consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits, as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.\\n\\nFor LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring resulting in mid-to- high-single-digits revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low-double-digits or the low 20s in constant currency driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365.\\n\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 22 and 24 percent in constant currency or $21.25 to $21.55 billion US dollars.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\n\\nWe expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1 \\n\\n\\n\\ntrends noted earlier. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.\\n\\nAnd in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single digits driven by Enterprise Support. \\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.5 to $14.9 billion US dollars. \\n\\nIn Windows OEM we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30 percent, again roughly in line with the PC market. \\n\\nIn Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. \\n\\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC should grow in the low-to-mid teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr.\\n\\nAnd in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid teens against a strong prior year comparable that included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-to-mid-teens. \\n\\nNow back to company guidance.\\n\\nWe expect COGS to grow between 6 and 7 percent in constant currency or to be between $17.4 and $17.6 billion US dollars and operating expense to \\n\\n\\n\\ngrow between 17 and 18 percent in constant currency or to be between $14.3 and $14.4 billion US dollars. As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. \\n\\nOther income and expense should be roughly $100 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements thru Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\\n\\nAnd we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent. \\n\\nAnd finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a 2.4-billion-dollar cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in the 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. \\n\\nNow some thoughts on the full fiscal year.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly 5-point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points.  \\n\\nAt the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20 percent constant currency growth in our commercial business driven by strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market. \\n\\nWith the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy costs, we now expect operating margins in US dollars to be down roughly a point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact from the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY23 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. \\n\\nIn closing, in this environment it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, security, Teams, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers.\\n\\nAnd while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally, and you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially thru the year while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we’ve made over the last year.\\n\\nWith that, let’s go to Q&A Brett?\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please ask only one question. Jessi, can you please repeat your instructions? \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what is obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point, but I think this is what’s on a lot of investors’ minds, is this is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth \\n\\n\\n\\ncame in a little bit below your guidance. And I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is there an inherent volatility in that business that’s just harder to forecast? \\n\\nAnd on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth, like the glide path for the full year? If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point better, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point worse. \\n\\nAnd I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. \\n\\nAnd as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are \\n\\n\\n\\nstill growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so, it’s this nuance of you’re still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth. \\n\\nWe saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused on. \\n\\nBut if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains, and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company, and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well.\\n\\nAnd so, as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it’s in customer success, whether it’s in optimizations, whether it’s, frankly, in engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us, even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity and TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in tech and technology. \\n\\nI don’t know, Satya, if you –\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I think that that’s the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point, is that obviously, our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you’re seeing. So, we’re going to stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize for long-term customer loyalty by proactively helping them optimize this spend, which I think is the right thing for us to be doing, as a company on behalf of our shareholders, long term. \\n\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Outstanding. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you. I’d like to follow up on the last question on Azure specifically. So next quarter, you’re guiding to sequential, further slowing in the business. Is that the factor of optimization? Is it something else that’s going on in here? How should we think about that, that specific component of the guidance, given the fact that you’ve got good bookings, strong RPO grow, etcetera? \\n\\n\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark. You’re right and let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you’re referring to, we had good what we would call long dated growth, which means we’re having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform. \\n\\nAnd that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so, it’s about both the optimization that you’re talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up, one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility. \\n\\nThe other piece of it, Mark, that we didn’t talk on before because I was really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well, right, because we’re getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in terms of the per-seat business.\\n\\nSo, there’s a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a very large base. It’s not just the optimization to new workloads. It’s also some per-user work as well.\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, last quarter you called out for the first time SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning, did that get worse this quarter? And did you see it filter now into the enterprise? Can you talk about what you’re seeing higher up above SMB? \\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about Microsoft 365. I think that’s a place where we can talk specifically about the SMB market, because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4. \\n\\nIn Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft. 365. We had on-time renewals that were, frankly, better in Q1, based on expirations, than we’d seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting done on time but getting done within a discount range that we feel good about, that’s consistent. And we saw good upsell to E5. So if you think about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that’s a good summary.\\n\\nWhere we in fact saw – I think we talked about it – new deal moderation, I’d referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well, it tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small-to-midsize companies, and it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit \\n\\n\\n\\nand I’d refer to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some new value that we’ve put into E3. \\n\\nThis is a place where there is some macro impact, but there’s also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto patching for Windows. It’s a great value in the same way E5 is. We land the E5 really well. We’ve got some work to do on landing E3. \\n\\nSo, there is some macro. It seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that I think, frankly, we can get better at as well.\\n\\nBRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, Thank you very much. Satya, this quarter, we’re seeing an inflection in many of your AI breakthroughs. I’m thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer product. What is it that’s enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I’m wondering if it’s the OpenAI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities, or something else. \\n\\nAnd then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of \\n\\n\\n\\ndimensionalize that incremental impact at something like 200 million per quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that through this period? \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it’s sort of important to call out that we build the supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly differentiated the way compute and the network, in particular, come along, come together in order to support these largescale training of these platform models or foundation models has been very critical. That’s what’s driven, in fact, the progress OpenAI has been making. \\n\\nAnd of course, we then productize it as part of Azure OpenAI Services. And that’s what we’re seeing both be used by our own first-party applications, whether it’s the GitHub Copilot or designer even inside Edge, and then of course the third party, like Mattel.\\n\\nAnd so, we’re very excited about it. We have a lot, sort of more to talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you’ll see more advances on GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The AI moment clearly has arrived and it’s going to be part of every product, whether it’s – in fact, you mentioned our Power Platform, because that’s another area where we’re innovating in terms of incorporating all of these AI models.\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability at an infrastructure layer for training and inference. And the model themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: And to your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a little bit of help there. We did not see as big of that. As I said, it’s over 800 for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2 through 4. And I think if you want to think about it as somewhere, 250-ish a quarter. It’s not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the remainder of the year. \\n\\nMARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, I’ve love to just ask you around margins. Clearly, you’re experiencing a little bit more sales mix, given the weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you’ve elected not to throttle back OpEx to enable you to meet the three-months-ago guidance for flat margins, so they’ll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows pressure? \\n\\n\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl, and I shared a little bit on the call, but let me share a little more because I think it’s important in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we’re seeing substantial opportunity and growth. \\n\\nThe PC market is cyclical, and we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic. And we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line. And you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did that intentionally because it is a cyclical market. \\n\\nAnd so, in the same way I see it now, is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows app install base, our ability to grow usage, it’s still higher than it was. And that’s a good opportunity for us. And so, in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it’s important to stay consistent in this down market, because when you have a type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about as being some of our most exciting, and you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it’s important to have a steady hand. \\n\\nNow, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It’ll be about investing \\n\\n\\n\\nwhere we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It’s about moving headcount to make sure, inside the company, we’ve got it on the highest and most important things. We’ve added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months, and we want to make sure we use those headcount in the most productive way possible. And we’re going to do that. \\n\\nAnd also, we’re going to, frankly, lap some investments that we’ve made at the end of H2, Karl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3. We closed Xander in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we’ll see productivity improvements from the headcount we have and our focus. \\n\\nAnd so, it’s the ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we’re responding to the macro. It’s possible to do both those things, and I think that’s what we’re doing. \\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Got it. Thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Oh, wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about Office Commercial. A lot of the growth here is driven by subscriber growth, this quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber growth of 14. Could you remind us where the \\n\\n\\n\\nincremental subscribers coming from? Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially over time? I think you’re already over 300 million subscribers, so just any color on just the runway from here. Where is the incremental coming from? \\n\\nAnd with all the work that you’re doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time? Thank you so much. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Brad. It’s a good question because you’ve continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways, because we’re focusing on frontline workers scenarios. We’re continuing to focus on small and midsize business growth, and we’re adding new things to which you can grow, whether that’s Viva, whether it’s Teams. There’s new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value, and then to add seats. \\n\\nAnd so, I don’t want to say it has to be, again, this vision of “or.” So, I think you’ll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we’ve been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we’ve added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. \\n\\nAnd so, you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you’ll see ASP show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, \\n\\n\\n\\nfrankly, each quarter. You saw a little more RPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there’s room to do both those things, and I’ve felt that way now for a couple of years. \\n\\nBRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Great to hear. Thanks, Amy. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Jessi, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nGREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Okay, thank you. Satya or Amy, as a follow up on Azure, I’m curious how you foresee the magnitude of two different variables on cloud computing demand over that near to medium term, the first being economic pressures on the willingness of some customers to spend, and the second being the impact of the spiking energy cost perhaps as a facilitator for some to do more in the cloud. Do you see these as largely offsetting factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter? Thank you. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, the way we see it is overall macro will mean that everybody’s going to optimize their build. In fact, as Amy said, our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them helping customers, quote/unquote, do more with less. So, that’s sort of one side. \\n\\nThe thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So, we see the value prop of the cloud. The big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. \\n\\nThe other side, as you described it, is the risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so, that’s another one. The best way to hedge against taking energy cost and be, in fact, more energy efficient is to move to the cloud. \\n\\nThat’s where I think a little bit of, as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud’s going to gain share, because we’re still in the early innings of adoption. And so, we just want to invest going into it with that mindset and build long-term customer loyalty. \\n\\nGREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Very helpful. Thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Gregg. Jessi, we have time for one last question. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRENT BRACELIN, Piper Sandler: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question here. Helpful color on cloud. I wanted to pivot to advertising. This was a segment that crossed over $10 billion, I think, earlier this year; \\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix rolling out ad-supported model next year, powered by Microsoft. What is the broader Microsoft advertising ambitions maybe three-to-five years here, given these are very large and very profitable segments that Microsoft has not historically focused on? Thanks.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: No, thanks for the question. Our core advertising business has got two elements to it. One is, I’ll call it LinkedIn B2B advertising, where we clearly have a leadership position around both reach, quality of our ROI, and we’ll continue. Of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn engagement continues to grow. And that is that market comes back. Our premium position with LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel very well positioned and we’ll continue to invest in that space. \\n\\nThe second one is the place where we are, again very, very focused on, first starting with our own owned and operated. So when we talk about the overall active devices of Windows having grown by 20% over the pandemic, one of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to take our own owned-and-operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and Search, whether it’s the feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are share takers in the browser. We are share takers in terms of the engagement of the feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that’s now structurally changed in terms of grow. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the third party with Netflix, we’re really excited about that. And we’re going to look to grow at first and make Netflix a successful partner. But we’re going to continue to grow our third-party business on the ad platform. \\n\\nSo, those would be the three areas, LinkedIn, our owned-and-operated advertising, both Search and Feed, as well as third-party ad network. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thank you. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nEND\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\preprocessing\\\\DATA\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q1.docx'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Microsoft FY23 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call\\xa0\\n\\nBrett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood\\xa0\\n\\nTuesday, January 24, 2023\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: \\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel.\\n\\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \\n\\nOn this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a\\xa0substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\xa0They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\\xa0\\n\\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. \\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being \\n\\n\\n\\nwebcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. \\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA:\\n\\nThank you, Brett.\\xa0\\n\\nI want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities.\\xa0\\n\\nAs I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear:\\xa0\\n\\nJust as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize that spend.\\xa0\\n\\nAlso, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd the next major wave of computing is being born, as we turn the world’s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform.\\xa0\\n\\nIn this environment, we remain convicted on three things:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long term loyalty and share position, while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth.\\xa0\\n\\nThis in turn sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd lastly we’re going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22 percent and 29 percent in constant currency.\\n\\nNow, I’ll highlight examples of our innovation, starting with Azure.\\xa0\\n\\nMoving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today’s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs, while gaining efficiencies of cloud-native development.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nEnterprises have moved millions of cores to Azure, and run twice as many cores on our cloud today than they did two years ago. And yet we are still in the early innings when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity.\\xa0\\n\\nAs an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20 percent by migrating to Azure, and reduced IT provisioning times from multiple months to just an hour.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe also continue to lead with hybrid computing, with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust, and PayPal.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to data.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nCustomers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration, and lower cost.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nBayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently, while meeting regulatory requirements. And ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to AI.\\xa0\\n\\nThe age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it.\\xa0We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI.\\xa0\\n\\nWe have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It’s being used by customers and partners, like OpenAI, to train state of the art models and services, including ChatGPT.\\xa0\\n\\nJust last week, we made Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, and already over 200 customers – from KPMG to Al Jazeera – are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd yesterday we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We’re pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider and will deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state of the art in AI.\\n\\nAll of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAzure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100 percent for five quarters in a row, with companies like AXA, FedEx, and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage, and govern their models.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to developers.\\xa0\\n\\nModernizing applications is mission-critical to any company’s operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio, and our Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help.\\xa0\\n\\nGitHub is now home to 100 million developers. And GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than one million people have used Copilot to date.\\xa0\\n\\nThis quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses, and we’ve seen strong interest and early adoption from companies including Duolingo, Lemonade, and Volkswagen’s CARIAD software group.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to Power Platform.\\xa0\\n\\nPower Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today’s environment.\\xa0\\n\\nWe are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite, spanning low-code/no-code tools, automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence.\\xa0\\n\\nWe are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers – from AT&T to Rabobank – up over 50 percent year-over-year.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd we’re making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, on to business applications.\\xa0\\n\\nDynamics 365 is taking share, as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience, and supply chain functions.\\xa0For example, G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nFujifilm is optimizing its operations.\\xa0Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence.\\xa0Baylor, Scott & White in Texas is using our Digital Contact Center Platform to enhance patient communications.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft-Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to industry solutions.\\xa0\\n\\nOur industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack.\\xa0\\n\\nOur Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF last week, as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology.\\xa0\\n\\nIn financial services, our new partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next-generation of data, analytics, and workspace solutions.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd in healthcare, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI.\\xa0\\n\\nWith Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, on to systems of work.\\xa0\\n\\nMicrosoft 365, Teams, and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work.\\xa0\\n\\nMicrosoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity, with both our established applications, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and Loop.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12 percent year-over-year, and we introduced Microsoft 365 “Basic,” bringing our premium offerings to more people.\\xa0\\n\\nTeams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic. And we continue to take share across every category, from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nTeams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Polly, ServiceNow, and Workday have each surpassed half a million active users, and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40 percent year-over-year.\\xa0\\n\\nThere are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70 percent year-over-year. And the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year. Novo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally, in our largest deal to date.\\xa0\\n\\nTeams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We’ve added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone.\\xa0\\n\\nWith Teams Premium, we’re meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We’ve seen \\n\\n\\n\\nstrong interest in preview, and we will make it broadly available next month.\\xa0\\n\\nWith Microsoft Viva, we’ve created a new market category for employee experience and organizational productivity.\\xa0\\n\\nUS Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications. And Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees.\\xa0\\n\\nIn today’s environment, aligning the entire organization on the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work.\\xa0\\n\\nViva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the “super app” in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We’ve seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter.\\xa0\\n\\nAll-up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nEighty percent of our enterprise customers use five or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, Ikea, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto, as well as the state government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to Windows.\\xa0\\n\\nWhile the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic, with time spent per PC up nearly 10 percent.\\xa0\\n\\nMonthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows, with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over two-thirds year-over-year.\\xa0\\n\\nLeaders in every industry, from Campari and Grant Thornton UK, to Nutrien and Woolworths, are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60 percent of the Fortune 500.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to security.\\xa0\\n\\nOver the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue, as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management, and privacy, informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day.\\xa0\\n\\nWe are taking share across all the major categories we serve.\\xa0\\n\\nCustomers are consolidating on our security stack, in order to reduce risk, complexity, and cost. The number of organizations with four or more workloads increased over 40 percent year-over-year.\\xa0\\n\\nUK retailer Fraser’s Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft.\\xa0\\n\\nRoku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory.\\xa0And Astella Pharma, Ferrovial, and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIEM capabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to LinkedIn.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell, and get hired.\\xa0\\n\\nWe once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over eighty percent of these members are from outside the United States.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10X year-over-year.\\xa0\\n\\nSkills are the new currency, and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles and industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd companies are also turning to a skills-based approach, in place of degree or pedigree, to identify qualified talent, with more than 45 percent of hirers on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles.\\xa0\\n\\nFinally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform.\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to advertising.\\xa0\\n\\nDespite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first- and third-party portfolios.\\xa0\\n\\nOur browser, Microsoft Edge, gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter.\\xa0Bing continues to gain share in the United States.\\xa0And daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30 percent year-over-year.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory.\\xa0\\n\\nWith Promote IQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer Endeavour, as well as Canada’s \\n\\n\\n\\nHudson’s Bay. And Globo, the largest Brazilian TV broadcaster, chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nNow, on to gaming.\\n\\nIn gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want.\\xa0\\n\\nWe saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours, and monthly active devices. And monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter.\\xa0\\n\\nWe continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company’s PC and mobile games, along with premium content, available to subscribers.\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, finally, we’re energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios. And we’ll be sharing details and game play at our showcase tomorrow.\\xa0\\n\\nIn closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers, and partners.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency, while raising the bar on our operational excellence.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that, I’ll hand it over to Amy.\\xa0\\n\\nAMY HOOD: \\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. \\n\\nI’d like to start by reiterating Satya’s thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week’s announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion, and earnings per share by $0.12.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2 percent and 7 percent in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2 percent and 8 percent in constant currency. Operating income decreased 3 percent and increased 6 percent in constant currency. And earnings per share was $2.32 cents – which decreased 6 percent and increased 2 percent in constant currency.\\n\\nIn our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.\\n\\nIn our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment, and we saw results weaken thru December. We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS, and Windows Commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. \\n\\nFrom a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world, however performance in the US was weaker than expected.\\n\\nImportantly, we continued to see share gains in areas such as Data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security, and Edge.  \\n\\nCommercial bookings increased 7 percent and 4 percent in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business noted earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 29 percent and 26 percent in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24 percent year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32 percent. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96 percent.\\n\\nFX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations.\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22 percent and 29 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72 percent, a point better than expected driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure.\\n\\nCompany gross margin percentage was 67 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. \\n\\nOperating expense, when adjusted for the Q2 charge, increased 11 percent and 13 percent in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition, and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount ended December 19 percent higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1 percent. Year-over-year growth included \\n\\n\\n\\nroughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively.\\n\\nAdjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact, as well as a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue.     \\n\\nNow to our segment results.\\n\\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7 percent and 13 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier.\\n\\nOffice commercial revenue grew 7 percent and 14 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11 percent and 18 percent in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 12 percent year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings - although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier.\\n\\nOffice consumer revenue declined 2 percent and increased 3 percent in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12 percent to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. \\n\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. \\n\\n\\n\\nDynamics revenue grew 13 percent and 20 percent in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21 percent and 29 percent in constant currency. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 8 percent and 16 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 12 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. \\n\\nOperating income increased 6 percent and 17 percent in constant currency, as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. \\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18 percent and 24 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. \\n\\nOverall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31 percent and 38 percent in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate particularly in December and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid 30s. \\n\\nIn our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 16 percent to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2 percent and increased 2 percent in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing.\\n\\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 2 percent and 7 percent in constant currency. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 17 percent and 23 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs. Operating expenses increased 34 percent and 37 percent in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, as roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge.\\n\\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19 percent and 16 percent in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial, and Search.\\n\\nWindows OEM revenue decreased 39 percent year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36 percent on a strong prior year comparable. \\n\\nDevices revenue decreased 39 percent and 34 percent in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches.\\n\\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3 percent and increased 3 percent in constant currency, lower than expected primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business in standalone offerings noted earlier.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 10 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, a bit lower than expected as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit. \\n\\nAnd in Gaming, revenue declined 13 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13 \\n\\n\\n\\npercent and 9 percent in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12 percent and 8 percent in constant currency given the strong first party content last year.\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 29 percent and 24 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year driven by lower Devices gross margin and sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47 percent and 40 percent in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.\\n\\nNow back to total company results.\\n\\nCapital expenditures including finance leases were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.3 billion. \\n\\nCash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23 percent year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7 percent and free cash flow declined 16 percent.\\n\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million,  lower than anticipated driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. \\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19 percent.\\n\\nAnd finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. \\n\\nMy commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.\\n\\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point, and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing.\\n\\nIn our consumer business, Windows OEM and Devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And, LinkedIn and Search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious.\\n\\nIn our commercial business, we expect the business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution given our strong position in durable growth markets.\\n\\nIn commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point driven by Azure.  \\n\\n\\n\\nIn capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Our data center investments continue to be based on near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities.\\n\\nNext to segment guidance. \\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11 and 13 percent in constant currency or $16.9 to $17.2 billion. \\n\\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly one point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid 20s. \\n\\nIn Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\\n\\nFor LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digits revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and a slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry where we have significant exposure.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365 which is now over 80 percent of total Dynamics revenue.\\n\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 17 and 19 percent in constant currency or $21.7 to $22 billion.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\n\\nIn Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid 30s in constant currency and from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about a point more than at the segment level.\\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. \\n\\nAnd in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services. \\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $11.9 to $12.3 billion. \\n\\nWindows OEM revenue should decline in the mid-to-high 30s in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid 40s, as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier.\\n\\nIn Windows commercial products and cloud services, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC should grow high-single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in Gaming, on a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour in third-party and first-party content. \\n\\nNow back to company guidance.\\n\\nWe expect COGS to grow between 1 and 2 percent in constant currency or to be between $15.65 and $15.85 billion and operating expenses to grow between 11 and 12 percent in constant currency or be $14.7 to $14.8 billion. \\n\\nOther income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\\n\\nWe expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent. \\n\\nAnd finally, as a reminder for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision. \\n\\nNow some thoughts on H2 and the full year.\\n\\nFirst, in our commercial business, revenue grew 20 percent on a constant currency basis in H1, however, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2 given how we exited December.  \\n\\nNext, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million.\\n\\n\\n\\nThird, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency.\\n\\nFinally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning costs and growth, investing in our customer’s success, and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs. \\n\\nIn the first half of the year, over 70 percent of our revenue came from our commercial business, and over 70 percent of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation in durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I’m confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near-term while continuing to position ourselves for the future.\\n\\nWith that, let’s go to Q&A. Brett?\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to the Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I was hoping we could delve into the expansion of the investment into OpenAI. And Satya, I was hoping to talk to us about, is there any expansion in the scope of what you guys are doing with OpenAI, and the commitment that you guys are making in terms of sort of the compute capacity you’re going to be given to them? \\n\\nAnd then maybe, from an investor’s perspective, how should we think about when this functionality is going to expand beyond just sort of the \\n\\n\\n\\nAzure OpenAI services, and when we’re going to start to see some of the positive impacts to perhaps Bing or the productivity suite, or more broadly across the solution portfolio?\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you so much, Keith, for the questions. As you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now three and a half years ago. And we’ve been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last three years. And so, I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI. And we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves, and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack, and also create new solutions and new opportunities. \\n\\nWhenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that’s how we come at it. How can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive? And then what new can be created?\\n\\nIf you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute, storage and network come together. That’s, in some sense, under the radar, if you will. For the last three and a half, four years, we’ve been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers, and now of course, the inference infrastructure, because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training heavy to inference. That’s sort of, I think, core Azure itself has been transformed and the infrastructure business is being transformed. \\n\\nAnd so, you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services, even. Think about what Synapse plus OpenAI API’s can do. You already have the Power Platform incorporated capability. You can prompt a workflow. I mean, one of the reasons why we’re the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI \\n\\n\\n\\ncapabilities that we have in there. GitHub Copilot is, in fact, I would say the most at-scale LLF-based product out there in the marketplace today. \\n\\nAnd so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it’s in productivity, whether it’s in our consumer services. And so, we’re excited about it, but I think that we’re also excited about OpenAI’s own innovation, right? They commercialized their products. We’re excited about the ChatGPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has. \\n\\nWe look to both there is an investment part to it and there’s a commercial partnership, but fundamentally, it’s going to be something that’s going to drive, I think, innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI.\\n\\nKEITH WEISS: Thank you, guys.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Satya, can you give us your overall macro view? There were some comments you had made that concerned, I think, many about the state of the U.S. spending environment. I’m just curious if you could comment and follow up on what you’re seeing there, just from the spend environment throughout the year. I think many came away with that perceiving that you were saying it’s getting worse, not better. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Thank you.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brent. First of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean, I always sort of subscribe to that there’s only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world, and then how many times that do we grow, because, as I said, even I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be \\n\\n\\n\\nmuch higher, and on a secular basis. The question is, how many times is it, given the overall inflation adjusted economic growth? That’s kind of how I look at it. \\n\\nGiven that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it’s even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic, they’re making sure that they’re getting most value out of it or optimizing it, and then also being a bit more cautious on, given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. \\n\\nGiven those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they’ll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. \\n\\nAnd so, one of the key things we’re watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this phase through our value propositions, and even build loyalty with our customers so that, long term, we are well positioned for share gain. That’s sort of fundamentally how we view it. \\n\\nAnd then the other aspect, I’d also say, is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend, because I don’t think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They’re all going to have considerations around how does my AI inference performance cost model is going to look like. And that’s where we are well-positioned again. \\n\\nThat’s how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what’s happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads. And that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up.\\n\\nBRENT THILL: Thank you.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much. I’d like to follow up a little bit on this question relating to optimization. I know we saw some slowing this quarter, you’re guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is, do you believe at this point, truly people optimizing what they’ve already bought, and stepping back before that, versus how much of that is due to macro-factors themselves specifically impacting demand?\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: I’d say two things, and then, Amy, please feel free to add. One is it absolutely starts with workloads that they have at scale, just because of the visibility one has on what’s driving, essentially, the consumption meters. And there’s real guidance that we ourselves entered in the product to say, here are things that you could do to optimize your billing. And so, that’s sort of what is the fundamental thing. When we say, do more with less, and how can we help, that’s sort of the first place customers go to.\\n\\nAnd then the next piece really, I think, is going to be about how do they take the optimization that they get, and the savings they get in one workload, and what new project starts. And that’s where there’s a reprioritization. When should we start a new project? Those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don’t perfectly match, but one of the things is they’re looking to back some savings on some workloads, and then start. \\n\\nThat’s where, I think, a little bit of what has to happen is a cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start, and then the projects ramp. And I think that that’s what, at least on the cloud consumption side, you’re seeing. \\n\\nAnd on the per-user side, it’s slightly different, which is in per user, also, there was real acceleration in terms of purchases of per-user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they’re \\n\\n\\n\\nall now making sure that they’re all getting used, and the usage is going up. When we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are up, year over year, in a substantial way. I gave you some of the Teams numbers. In fact, one of the things was what’ll happen to Teams usage after pandemic. Guess what? They’re up.\\n\\nAnd so, that’s good news. And now, once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added at premium. I’m very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all things that we will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPU are also going up in value. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: And Mark, because I do think it’s actually quite hard to separate, from a driver perspective, how much is optimization versus macro, it’s all related when you start to say, what’s the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend. And our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. \\n\\nSatya talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user, where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates, and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product, where the cycle is going to be a little longer, you’re going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth, and you can see the consistency, potentially, in both renewal rate and frankly within Microsoft 365 performance.\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER: Perfect, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Satya, I’m curious if you could talk about how long the cycle time for optimization is. Are we talking a couple of quarters, three quarters or multiple years, because I do \\n\\n\\n\\ntake your comment about that tech spending is percentage of global GDP going higher? If that were to happen, how do you frame the duration of this optimization that’s happening in the industry? Thank you so much.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: I mean, I think that you have a workload, you optimize the workload, and you start a new workload. The thing that I would say is when you’re done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. \\n\\nI think, if you sort of say, when did we enter this, we accelerated a bunch of workloads during the pandemic over a period of two years. We are optimizing. I don’t think we’re going to take two years to optimize. But we’re going to take this year to optimize and then, as we optimize, the new project start. The new project starts don’t start instantly at the peak usage. They start and then they scale. And so, those are the two cycles that will happen, where there will be a time block.\\n\\nKASH RANGAN: Got it. It’s a temporary adjustment before we start to get the full effect of the next set of workloads. Good to get that.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: That’s correct, that’s correct.\\n\\nKASH RANGAN: Thank you.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. This one for Amy. Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency commercial revs guide would be tough. Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10% plus total revenue growth for the year? \\n\\nAnd if I could just sneak in a clarification, Amy, just because it’s an important metric, when you talk about a 4-to-5 point decel in Azure, that’s \\n\\n\\n\\noff of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? Thank you.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Karl, the first half of your question, give me a second on the second half of your question, which is, is the guide off the exit rate? It’s off the exit rate on Azure of 4 to 5 points, just to make sure that is clear. \\n\\nIn terms of thinking about total year revenue, you’re right, I did not comment on full year revenue as we continue, I think, really just to watch the Windows PC market as it returns to pre-pandemic levels. Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. \\n\\nIn some ways, it’s important because when you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we’re guiding to really only 1 point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis, with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about the place that puts us in, as we exit the year in terms of in the right energy we’re leaving the year in Q4 on leverage.\\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks, Amy.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks very much. Amy, I wanted to ask about the expense actions that you announced last week, obviously, not a decision that you would take lightly. How are you thinking about headcount for the remainder of the year and the possibility for further expense actions, if necessary? And what criteria do you consider in making these decisions? Thanks.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low single-digit operating expense growth, \\n\\n\\n\\nwe start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year, and we lap the acquisitions, both of Nuance and Xander. By the time that gets to the end of Q4, you’ll see very moderated headcount growth on a year over year basis, in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we’ve made. \\n\\nAnd you’re right, we take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously, because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that. \\n\\nAnd so, I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. As I said, it’ll certainly imply that year over year growth as we lap some of the investment that we made will be quite small.\\n\\nBRAD ZELNICK: Thanks for the color.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRAD REBACK, Stifel: Great, thanks very much. In Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you’re putting forth, should we think about the growth they’re more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU, going forward, or are we still to continue to favor seats? Thanks.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: That’s a good question, especially because this quarter, you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question, and I’ll just reinforce it, as we see some of these moderating seat growth, whether that’s some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you’re starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. It does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. \\n\\nWe’re seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads. And, as you’re pointing out, we’re getting further into the E5 health, where we’ve \\n\\n\\n\\nseen, I want to say, four or five really good quarters of E5 adoption. The value there is just very high for customers in this environment, between analytics, security, and I think we’ve given some, I think, good security data points in terms of adoption, and voice. This is a place where customers can save money by moving to this suite. And I do think you’re starting to see some of that ARPU help.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: And we are also investing in, outside of Microsoft 365, other per-user workloads, Viva being a new suite, Power Platform on its own, and even standalone offers, like even Teams Pro and what have you. There’s a significant amount of work we want to do besides the sort of the suites that we all sort of have at scale.\\n\\nBRAD REBACK: Great. Thank you very much.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Joe, we have time for one last question.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nTYLER RADKE, CITI: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just about how your visibility has changed in terms of some of the larger Azure customer ramps. Could you just comment to the extent those large customer ramps or if any of those projects are getting put on pause? And then is there any way to just kind of quantify the AI potential contribution or maybe GPU-powered contribution to Azure that you’re expecting over the coming quarters? Thank you.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: On the second piece, I think it’s too early to sort of start somehow separating out AI from the rest of the workload. I mean, even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just AI alone. In other words, if you have an application that’s using a bunch of inference, let’s say, it’s also going to have a bunch of storage, and it’s going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. I think over time, obviously, I think every app is \\n\\n\\n\\ngoing to be an AI app. That’s, I think, the best way to think about this transformation.\\n\\nOn your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in that trajectory, I would point back to, I think, some of the common theme around every large customer is looking to optimize the workload that they have at scale today, and plow some of that money back that they save into new project structure. That’s sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is. \\n\\nSometimes, you will have ISVs who are different, right? If an ISV is optimizing, they optimize and say, what is the new set of features to add at what ramp. All that said, as Amy noted in her remarks, last quarter we added more long-term customer commitments to Azure, and it’s great to see that continue.*\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nEND OF AUDIO\\n\\nComplete answer included in transcript but not captured in the webcast\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\preprocessing\\\\DATA\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q2.docx'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Microsoft FY23 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call\\n\\nBrett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood\\n\\nTuesday, April 25, 2023\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: \\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel.\\n\\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, new this quarter, more detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today’s call.\\n\\nOn this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a\\xa0substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\xa0They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in \\n\\n\\n\\nfurther understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\\xa0\\n\\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. \\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. \\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the \\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much, Brett. \\n\\nThe Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack.\\n\\nWe continue to focus on three priorities:\\n\\nFirst, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend.\\n\\nSecond, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas, and expanding our TAM.\\n\\nAnd, third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.\\n\\nNow, I’ll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.\\n\\nAzure took share, as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric – from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it’s being used by our partner OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA, and leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. \\n\\nOur Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. \\n\\nFrom Coursera and Grammarly, to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10X quarter-over-quarter.\\n\\nJust last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. \\n\\nAzure also powers OpenAI API. And we’re pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI’s models.\\n\\nMore broadly, we continue to see the world’s largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud.\\n\\nUnilever, for example, went all-in on Azure this quarter, in one of the largest-ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry.\\n\\nIKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra, and Wolverine Worldwide all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud \\n\\n\\n\\nenvironments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year.\\n\\nAnd we’re extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. \\n\\nWe are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel, and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.\\n\\nNow, on to data. \\n\\nOur Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics, and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. \\n\\nCosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale.\\n\\nOpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service – one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever – enabling high reliability and low maintenance.\\n\\nThe NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer, and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed-to-insight. \\n\\nNow, on to developers.\\n\\nFrom Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud – all while staying in their flow. \\n\\nToday, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship, and maintain software.\\n\\nAnd with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we’re fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer, from novices to experts.\\n\\nIn three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM, as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers.  \\n\\nWe’re also bringing next generation AI to Power Platform, so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents, and analyze data using only natural language.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform. \\n\\nAnd with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we’re extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks.\\n\\nAll-up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year.\\n\\nNow, on to business applications.\\n\\nFrom customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve, as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate, and predict every business process and function.\\n\\nAnd we’re going further, with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and notetaking.  \\n\\nNow, on to our industry and cross-industry solutions.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan, and PCL, as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments.\\n\\nOur Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week, as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers.\\n\\nWe showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. \\n\\nAnd, at Hannover-Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows.\\n\\nNow, on to future of work.\\n\\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot combines next generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work.\\n\\nCopilot works alongside users, embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’ve been encouraged by early feedback, and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months.\\n\\nTeams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter. \\n\\nAnd we once again took share across every category — from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling — as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys, and Vodafone. \\n\\nWe announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50% less memory, so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot.\\n\\nTeams is also expanding our TAM. Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms, or Premium.\\n\\nTeams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce costs with a three-year ROI of over 140%.\\n\\nTeams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year. \\n\\nAnd Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps. Now generally available, it’s one of our fastest growing Modern Work products ever, with thousands of paid customers just two months in.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Microsoft Viva, we’ve created a completely new suite for employee experience. \\n\\nViva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics, and employee feedback. Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard, and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive.\\n\\nJust last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement.  \\n\\nAnd with Viva Sales, we’ve extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data, so they can automatically generate content, like customer mails.\\n\\nAll this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk, and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps, along with advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. \\n\\nNow, on to Windows.\\n\\nWhile the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices, and higher usage, compared to pre-pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11.\\n\\nAnd with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows. \\n\\nAll-up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to date. And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time.\\n\\nNow, on to security.\\n\\nOur comprehensive, AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders.\\n\\nAmong analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider, and we once again took share across all major categories we serve.\\n\\nAnd we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers.\\n\\nWith Security Copilot, we’re combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities, along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year.\\n\\nAnd, all-up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation.\\n\\nEY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations.\\n\\nNow, on to LinkedIn.\\n\\nWe once again saw record engagement, as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell, and get hired. \\n\\nMember growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter, as we expanded to new audiences.\\n\\nWe now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw a 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign ups.\\n\\nIn this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity. Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function, from marketing, sales, and finance, to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills, with more than 100 AI courses. \\n\\nAnd we’ve introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions, and collaborative articles. \\n\\nFinally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe, trusted platform.\\n\\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising.\\n\\nOur exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated, premium video content to our ad network.\\n\\nAnd, our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits.\\n\\nTwo months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we’re very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns.\\n\\nAll-up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. \\n\\nWe are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4X since launch.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter, and Bing once again grew share in the United States.\\n\\nWe continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts, powered by Dall-E. Over 200 million images have been created to date. \\n\\nAnd, we see that when people use these new AI features, their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up.\\n\\nAs we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entrypoints across Bing, Edge, Windows, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\\n\\nWe look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category – search.\\n\\nNow, on to gaming.\\n\\nWe are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however, and wherever they want. \\n\\nWe set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. \\n\\n\\n\\nAcross our content & services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love. \\n\\nOur revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter.\\n\\nThis quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we’re available.\\n\\nGreat content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first party titles. \\n\\nAnd I’ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall. \\n\\nIn closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance, as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI.\\n\\nIn a few weeks times, we’ll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers. And I encourage you to tune in.\\n\\nI could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead.\\n\\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Amy.\\n\\n\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency.\\n\\nOur results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners. In our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency. We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365 which also benefited Windows Commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition. In Office 365 standalone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2. In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected.\\n\\nIn our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations.\\n\\nWe have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge, and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next generation AI capabilities.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable, with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier.\\n\\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%.\\n\\nFX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations.\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by lower Azure margin. \\n\\n\\n\\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue.\\n\\nOperating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago. \\n\\nOperating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency.\\n\\nNow to our segment results.\\n\\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial.\\n\\nOffice commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, \\n\\n\\n\\nslightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.\\n\\nOffice commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan.\\n\\nOffice consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million. \\n\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. \\n\\nDynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency with healthy growth across all workloads. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses \\n\\n\\n\\nincreased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. \\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. \\n\\nOverall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency.\\n\\nIn our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing.\\n\\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\\n\\n\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate.\\n\\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. \\n\\nWindows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations. We saw better-than-expected PC demand as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels.\\n\\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S. \\n\\nAnd in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass.\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency.\\n\\nNow back to total company results.\\n\\nCapital expenditures including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.6 billion.\\n\\nCash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization \\n\\n\\n\\nprovision and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%.\\n\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. \\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19%.\\n\\nAnd finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\nNow, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. \\n\\nMy commentary, for next quarter and FY24, does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.\\n\\nNow to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue thru Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth.\\n\\nLast year we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large, multi-year commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitments to our platform as we focus on meeting customers’ changing contract needs, which include shorter-term, quick time-to-value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. \\n\\nWe expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. \\n\\n\\n\\nNext to segment guidance. \\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10 and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 to $18.2 billion US dollars.\\n\\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. \\n\\nIn Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\\n\\nFor LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digits revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.\\n\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 to $23.9 billion US dollars.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\n\\nIn Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven \\n\\n\\n\\nby our Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4 as noted earlier. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.\\n\\nAnd in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services. \\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 to $13.75 billion US dollars. \\n\\nPC demand should be similar to Q3 and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s.\\n\\nIn Windows commercial products and cloud services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth \\n\\n\\n\\ncan have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue that’s similar to Q3.\\n\\nAnd in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. \\n\\nNow back to company guidance.\\n\\nWe expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 to $17 billion US dollars and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 to $15.2 billion US dollars. \\n\\nOther income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\\n\\nWe expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd finally, as a reminder for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. \\n\\nNow I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year.\\n\\nWith our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability.\\n\\nAs with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation, and we are excited about the early feedback and demand signal for the AI capabilities we have announced to date. We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend, as we scale with the growing demand driven by customer transformation. And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time.\\n\\nAs always, we remain committed to aligning costs and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled capex investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY24 operating expense growth to remain low. \\n\\nAs a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of \\n\\n\\n\\ndecades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it.  \\n\\nWith that, let’s go to Q&A. Brett?\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results and what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there. I think it really illustrates Microsoft’s advantages, and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about. \\n\\nI wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else, and one that I, frankly, don’t have a good answer to, and that’s around the OpenAI partnership, and particularly the accounting for that partnership. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there’s any impact, just to give us a better understanding of how the accounting around that relationship is working. \\n\\n\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. In some ways, let me start by saying it’s a great partnership. We’re proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you’ve heard us make more recently. And we’ve talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us. \\n\\nBut specifically to your question on how does it show up, it’s easiest in this situation to think about them as a customer of ours, like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI Services in service of supporting their end customers. And so, when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf. \\n\\nThat’s probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful. \\n\\nKEITH WEISS: Yeah, that’s super helpful. I appreciate that. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance, and thanks for taking my question. I’d like to drill into Azure, and more specifically, Azure IaaS PaaS consumption. IaaS PaaS consumption is really stepped down recently, and it’s important to understand the macro versus an optimization that will rebound, whether it’s going to rebound \\n\\n\\n\\nquickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is this simply purely macro, and everyone is stepping back a little bit, and they’re going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back, or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that that slowdown to sustain even when the IT spending rebound? Thank you. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. Maybe I’ll make three comments. And it’s also important, I think, to distinguish between what I would say is macro or absolute performance and relative performance, because I think that’s perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business. \\n\\nFirst is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization, because we believe, in the long run, that’s the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers, when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workflow. That’s sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we’re taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time. \\n\\nThe second thing I’d say is we do have new workloads started, because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre-pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. What we’re seeing now is the new \\n\\n\\n\\nworkloads start, in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have. \\n\\nThe third is perhaps more of a relative statement. Because of some of the work we’ve done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations, whether it’s coming to you in just OpenAI’s APIs, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to OpenAI and are using their API. These are not customers of Azure at all. \\n\\nSecond, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new and the workload conversations, whether it’s B2C conversations in financial services, or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are.\\n\\nThose are the three comments I would make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think what is our relative market position and how it’s being changed.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: That’s maybe the one thing I would add to those comments, is we’ve been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we’re starting tons of new workloads – we’ll call that the pandemic time – to this transition post, and we’re coming to really the anniversary of that starting. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, to Satya’s point, we’re continuing to incent optimization, but at some point, workloads just can’t be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps, year over year. And so, you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis.\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER: That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate it. Thank you for the color, and again, congratulations on what’s happening. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how this shows up, where we’re going to see it? And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through a copilot, say 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the suite, or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they’re consumption meters or per-user subscriptions. The copilot that’s priced, and it is there, is GitHub Copilot. That’s a good example of incrementally how we monetize the price lists out there, and others are to be priced, because we are in preview mode. But you can expect us to do what we’ve done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board. \\n\\n\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Yeah, Brent, the best way of thinking about this is when we believe we’re adding a lot of value, and frankly, that’s what the copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have a list price for those. And you’ll be able to look at that as we get to release. And to Satya’s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example. \\n\\nBRENT THILL: Thanks. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have the next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nRAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. And just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure, can you just, Satya, maybe talk a little bit about how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads? And how do you think that will evolve over time? Thank you.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah, a couple of things. One is clearly, the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI. And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what a hyperscaler does is not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload, and in fact heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, we have many knobs that will continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even for a given generation of a large model, where we start with the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint, even in a period of a quarter, changes. So, you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. \\n\\nThe other thing I would mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. One of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said this type of workload, whether it’s a training or an inference workload, is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI. And so, you can see, I’ll supply in other contexts as well. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to, is that it’s not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads. It’s that really, even our first-party workloads and apps that are built are built on the same platform. \\n\\nAnd we’re able, because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first party, as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we’re able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI \\n\\n\\n\\nservices utilization across the stack. And so, it’s not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler. \\n\\nRAIMO LENSCHOW: Thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please. \\n\\nKEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Amy, I wanted to address this to you, if I could. On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flush that out with some broader comments. Excuse me. \\n\\nCould you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix, and particularly supporting generative AI, and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year? Thank you.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. And this is probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is you look at all of the businesses we’re in, and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is where Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I’ll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains. \\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that Satya’s talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that, while we continue to focus on our customers’ success and getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that’s the E5 product of Microsoft 365, whether that’s Windows 365 to help. Maybe it’s on compute costs and PC cost, whether it’s working across the Azure stack. \\n\\nAnd so, with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we’ve had in Windows that are still being used more, being able to focus on Edge share, and Bing share and gaming, bringing it to the PC as well as across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on, as we think about next year.\\n\\nAnd so, if we feel like, and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say great. And we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about. We’ll increase COGS growth, but we’re committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low. \\n\\nAnd so, what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future, to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. While I know that’s not giving specificity, it is in fact how we think about long-term success, is being well-\\n\\n\\n\\npositioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we’re going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the buildout. We will charge for those AI capabilities, and then ultimately, we’ll deliver operating profit. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think, as shareholders, you may want to look at is what’s the opportunity set ahead when we have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have, both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead, and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack. \\n\\nAnd so, therefore, that’s the sort of approach we’re going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all, as shareholders, long term? That’s sort of where we look at it. And we’ll manage the P&L carefully, driving operating leverage in a disciplined way, but not being shy of investing where we need to invest, in order to grab the long-term opportunity. \\n\\nAnd so, obviously we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&L flow, but we feel good about our position. \\n\\nKEITH BACHMAN: All right, many thanks for the answer. \\n\\n\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. \\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks. We’ve had a lot of questions on AI and Azure, so maybe just to round it out, just on the Office 365 business, Amy, 16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market. So, it’s proven to be very resilient. \\n\\nCould you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat based business, it doesn’t seem to be showing up? Maybe you could just help us understand what’s driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Yeah. Thanks, Karl. I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite, but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users. And so, if you think about the users and on the global base, we’ve been able to add users, which you continue to see, we still have in the frontline scenario and an SMB opportunity to continue to grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in those places. And we continue to see customers committed to the value they’re getting. \\n\\nAnd so, this is not something that I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continuing to add new products and renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, I think that’s the story of the resilience you’re seeing. And, of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you’re starting to see, and it helps on RPU. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please. \\n\\nRISHI JALURIA, RBC: Wonderful. Hi, Satya. Hi, Amy. Thanks so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued resilience in the business. I wanted to get back to the topic of AI, but think maybe a little bit longer term. How are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data, and customer privacy and governance? And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments, and customers and organizations have around that? Thanks. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Overall, we’ve taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that, from day one, we think about as first class, and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. \\n\\nFor example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles. We translated the AI principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process, that then we hold ourselves to internal audit, essentially. That’s the framework we have. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are, and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so, we feel very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. \\n\\nAnd so, we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in the AI, I think we stand to gain from that.\\n\\nRISHI JALURIA: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Rishi. Joe, we have time for one last question. \\n\\nMICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioned for, given that’s something we hear clearly top of mind for IP decision makers currently. You have clear plays across security infrastructure apps in other areas. So, it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you’re particularly focused on or seeing the most traction around. Thank you. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I’ll start, and then, Amy, you can add. \\n\\nI think Amy referenced this in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365, but fundamentally, what we’re focused on is making sure that the \\n\\n\\n\\ncustomers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, whether it’s the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it’s E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that they’re getting deployed, they’re getting used. And that’s obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases. \\n\\nSame thing in security. That’s a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us. And same all up and down the stack across Azure. \\n\\nWhen you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model. In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example. ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database. And so, therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it’s the IaaS layer, or the PaaS layer, or the SaaS layer.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that’s going to get done, whether that’s the Dynamics workloads that we’ve talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available in Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities, as well actually some front end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way. \\n\\nAnd so, I think maybe it’s not the traditional definition of consolidation, but when people look and say, what vendor adds a lot of value and has the tools that we need, and in many instances already own, to be able to do \\n\\n\\n\\nthis business process work, I think we have a great, great value, and frankly, probably leading tools in almost every vertical. \\n\\nMICHAEL TURRIN: Great, thank you.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thank you.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you, all. Thanks so much.\\n\\nEND\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\preprocessing\\\\DATA\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q3.docx'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Microsoft FY23 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\\n\\nBrett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood\\n\\nTuesday, July 25, 2023\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel.\\n\\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today’s call.\\n\\nOn this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. \\n\\n\\n\\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. \\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. \\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much, Brett.\\n\\nWe had a solid close to our fiscal year. \\n\\nThe Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, up 27% in constant currency, with Azure all-up accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time.\\n\\nEvery customer I speak with is asking not only how, but how fast, they can apply next generation AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – and to do so safely and responsibly.\\n\\nTo that end, we remain focused on three key priorities: \\n\\nFirst, helping customers use the breadth and depth of Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their spend.\\n\\nSecond, investing to lead in the new AI platform shift by infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack.\\n\\nAnd, third, driving operating leverage.\\n\\nNow, I’ll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.\\n\\nAzure continues to take share, as customers migrate their existing workloads and invest in new ones.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continue to see more cloud migrations, as it remains early when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.\\n\\nWe are also seeing increasing momentum with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers, up 150% year-over-year, including Carnival Corp., Domino’s, Thermo Fisher.\\n\\nAnd Azure AI is ushering in new, born-in-the cloud AI-first workloads, with the best selection of frontier and open models, including Meta’s recent announcement supporting Llama on Azure and Windows, as well as OpenAI.\\n\\nWe have great momentum across Azure OpenAI Service.\\n\\nMore than 11,000 organizations across industries, including Ikea, Volvo Group, Zurich Insurance, as well as digital natives like Flipkart, Humane, Kahoot, Miro, Typeface, use the service.\\n\\nThat’s nearly 100 new customers added every day this quarter.\\n\\nMercedes-Benz, for example, is bringing ChatGPT via Azure OpenAI to more than 900,000 vehicles in the United States, making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive. And Moody’s built its own internal copilot to improve productivity of its 14,000 employees.\\n\\nWe are also partnering broadly to scale this next generation of AI to more customers. \\n\\n\\n\\nSnowflake, for example, will increase its Azure spend as it builds new integrations with Azure OpenAI. And, KPMG has announced a multi-billion-dollar commitment to our cloud and AI services to transform professional services.\\n\\nNow, on to data. \\n\\nEvery AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever.\\n\\nOur Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate.\\n\\nWe introduced Microsoft Fabric this quarter, which unifies compute, storage, and governance, with a disruptive business model.\\n\\nOne month in, we are encouraged by early interest and usage. Over 8,000 customers have signed up to trial the service and are actively using it. And over 50% are using four or more workloads.\\n\\nAll-up, we once again took share with our analytics solutions, with customers like Bridgestone, Chevron, and Equinor turning to our stack.\\n\\nNow, on to developers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy models – and do so responsibly. \\n\\nVS Code and GitHub Copilot are category-leading products when it comes to how developers code every day.\\n\\nNearly 90% of GitHub Copilot sign-ups are self-service, indicating strong organic interest and pull through. \\n\\nMore than 27,000 organizations – up 2X quarter-over-quarter – have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business to increase the productivity of their developers, including Airbnb, Dell, and Scandinavian Airlines. \\n\\nWe’re also applying AI across low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts automate workflows, create apps and web pages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language.  \\n\\nCopilot in Power BI combines the power of large language models with an organization’s data to generate insights faster. And Copilot in Power Pages makes it easier to create secure, low-code business websites.\\n\\nOne of our tools that has really taken off is Copilot in Power Virtual Agents, which is delivering one of the biggest benefits of this new era of AI: helping customer service agents be significantly more productive.\\n\\n\\n\\nHP and Virgin Money, for example, have both built custom chatbots with Copilot in Power Virtual Agents that were trained to answer complex customer inquiries.\\n\\nAll-up, more than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 75% quarter-over-quarter.\\n\\nFinally, Power Automate now has 10 million monthly active users at companies like Jaguar Land Rover, Repsol, Rolls-Royce, up 55% year-over-year. \\n\\nAnd we’re going further with new process mining capabilities in Power Automate, which are helping organizations optimize business processes – and in turn build their AI advantage. \\n\\nNow, on to business applications.\\n\\nWe are taking share in every category, as we help organizations across the private and public sector – from Avis, to Albertsons Companies, to Breville, to Equinox, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs – transform their mission-critical business processes.\\n\\nAll-up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and finance & supply chain businesses all surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis quarter, we brought Dynamics 365 Copilot to our ERP portfolio, including finance, project operations, and supply management.\\n\\nAnd with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot sellers can ground their customer interactions with data from CRM systems – including both Salesforce and Dynamics – to personalize customer interactions and close more deals.\\n\\nNow, on to our industry and cross-industry clouds.\\n\\nOur Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is helping customers like Costco, Land O’Lakes, and REI take action to meet their environmental goals. \\n\\nAnd, in healthcare, hundreds of organizations are using our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution to automatically document patient encounters at the point of care.\\n\\nThis quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Epic to integrate Nuance DAX Express directly into their industry leading EHR system.\\n\\nNow, on to future of work.\\n\\nAcross industries, customers like Ahold Delhaize, Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Siemens, Wells Fargo are choosing Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice, and analytics value. \\n\\nAnd four months ago, we introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are now rolling out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 600 paid customers through our early access program, and feedback from organizations like Emirates NBD, General Motors, Goodyear, and Lumen is that it’s a game changer for employee productivity.\\n\\nWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calling.\\n\\nWe now have more than 1,900 apps in Teams app store. And companies in every industry, from British Airways, to Dentsu, to Eli Lilly and Manulife, have built over 145,000 custom line of business apps, bringing business process directly into the flow of work.\\n\\nFive months in, Teams Premium has already surpassed 600,000 seats, as companies like BNY Mellon, Clifford Chance, PepsiCo, and Starbucks, chose the add-on for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.\\n\\nTeams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling, with more than 17 million PSTN users, up 45% year-over-year.\\n\\nTeams Rooms is used by more than 70% of the Fortune 500 – including L’Oreal, United Airlines, and US Bank. And revenue more than doubled year-over-year this quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd with Microsoft Viva, we are creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva now has 35 million monthly active users, as companies like CBRE, Fujitsu, and Unisys turn to the platform to build data-driven, high-performance organizations. \\n\\nNow, on to Windows.\\n\\nThe number of devices running Windows 11 has more than doubled in the last year, and we are seeing continued growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments worldwide by companies like AT&T, Krones, and Westpac.\\n\\nWe are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed for enterprise customers with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months.\\n\\nEnbridge, Eurowings, Marriott International, and TD Bank Group, for example, all chose cloud-delivered Windows this quarter.\\n\\nWindows 11 is also rapidly becoming a powerful new canvas in this new era of AI.\\n\\nWe introduced Windows Copilot this quarter, helping every Windows 11 user become a power user with just natural language, and are excited to put it in the hands of more people in the coming months.\\n\\nNow, on to Security.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than one million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms, up 26% year-over-year. \\n\\nMore than 60% – including leading enterprises like ABN AMRO, Dow, and HEINEKEN – use 4 or more of our security products, up 33% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation.\\n\\nAnd we once again took share across all major categories we serve, as we innovate to protect customers.\\n\\nIn identity, Microsoft Entra ID has more than 610 million monthly active users.\\n\\nAnd we are adding SSE to our Entra product family to complement our leading identity solution, and secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere. \\n\\nFinally, our Security Copilot – the first product to apply this next generation of AI to SecOps – will be available to customers via a paid early access program this fall.  \\n\\nNow, on to LinkedIn.\\n\\nLinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year and membership growth has now accelerated for eight quarters in a row, a \\n\\n\\n\\ntestament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.\\n\\nOur Talent Solutions business surpassed $7 billion in revenue for the first time over the past 12 months, and our hiring business took share for the fourth consecutive quarter.\\n\\nWe continue to use AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into experiences of experts on the platform. Our AI-powered collaborative articles are now the fastest-growing traffic driver to LinkedIn.\\n\\nAnd finally, we’re helping LinkedIn stay trusted and authentic. More than 7 million members have verified who they are or where they work, many using new integrations with Microsoft Entra, as well as CLEAR and Hyperverge.\\n\\nNow, on to search, advertising, and news.\\n\\nWhile it’s early in our journey, we are reshaping daily search and web habits with our Copilot for the web.\\n\\nThis quarter, we introduced new AI-powered features, including multimodal capabilities with visual search in Bing Chat. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re expanding to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of this next generation of AI today. \\n\\nBing is also the default search experience for OpenAI’s ChatGPT, bringing timelier answers with links to reputable sources to ChatGPT users. \\n\\nTo date, Bing users have engaged in more than one billion chats and created more than 750 million images with Bing Image Creator. And Microsoft Edge took share for the ninth consecutive quarter. \\n\\nMore broadly, we’re growing our ad network, which is now available in 187 markets, spanning search, display, native, retail media, video, and connected TV. \\n\\nNow, on to gaming.\\n\\nLast week we extended our Activision Blizzard merger agreement deadline to October. We continue to work through the regulatory approval process and remain confident about getting the deal done. \\n\\nWe are committed to bringing more games to more players everywhere.\\n\\nGreat content is key to our approach, and our pipeline has never been stronger. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe announced our most ambitious line up of games ever at our showcase last month, including 21 titles that will be available via Xbox Game Pass. \\n\\nAnd we’re looking forward to the release of Starfield this fall, Bethesda’s first new universe in 25 years.\\n\\nAll-up, we set new fourth quarter highs for monthly active users, driven by strength off-console, as well as monthly active devices. And we saw record fourth quarter engagement across Game Pass, with hours played up 22% year-over-year.  \\n\\nAnd just last week, we announced Game Pass Core, bringing together online play from Xbox Live and content from Game Pass into a single offering.\\n\\nIn closing, I am energized about the opportunities ahead.\\n\\nWe continue to innovate across the tech stack to help our customers thrive in the new era of AI.\\n\\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Amy.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.2 billion, up 8% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.69 and increased 21% and 23% in constant currency.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our largest quarter of the year, results exceeded expectations with focused execution by our sales and partner teams. These execution efforts led to share gains again this quarter in Azure, Dynamics, Security, and Edge.\\n\\nIn our commercial business, we continued to see healthy renewal strength which includes our upsell and attach motions, particularly with Microsoft 365 E5. Growth of new business continued to be moderated for products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite including standalone Office 365, EMS, and Windows Commercial products. As expected in Azure, we saw a continuation of the optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter.\\n\\nIn our consumer business, the PC market overall was in line with expectations although the early timing of back-to-school inventory builds benefitted Windows OEM. Advertising spend was slightly lower than anticipated which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. \\n\\nCommercial bookings decreased 2% and 1% in constant currency, in line with expectations, against a prior year comparable that was our largest commercial bookings quarter ever. In addition to the healthy execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier, we saw a record number of 10-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. And, the average annualized value for our large, long-term Azure contracts was the highest it’s ever been, driven by customer demand for \\n\\n\\n\\nour innovative cloud solutions today as well as the interest in AI opportunities ahead.\\n\\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 19% and 18% in constant currency to $224 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 13% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 22%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%.\\n\\nFX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 1 point, 1 point favorable to expectations.\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $30.3 billion and grew 21% and 23% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year to 72%, also slightly ahead of expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\\n\\nCompany gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the \\n\\n\\n\\nimpact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvements in Office 365.\\n\\nOperating expense increased 2%, in line with expectations, as savings across the company from our focus on prioritization and efficiency were offset by the charge related to the Irish Data Protection Commission matter. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was flat compared to a year ago. \\n\\nOperating income increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 4 points year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 2 points driven by improved operating leverage through disciplined cost management.\\n\\nNow to our segment results.\\n\\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.3 billion and grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results in Office Commercial, partially offset by LinkedIn.\\n\\nOffice commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, a bit better than expected with particular strength in E5 upsell at renewal noted earlier. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year with \\n\\n\\n\\ninstalled base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.\\n\\nOffice commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency with better-than-expected transactional purchasing.\\n\\nOffice consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 67 million. \\n\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions with some continued bookings impact from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Growth was partially offset by a decline in Marketing Solutions due to the lower ad spend noted earlier. \\n\\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 21% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 26% and 28% in constant currency with continued healthy growth across all workloads. \\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 16% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased slightly, and operating income \\n\\n\\n\\nincreased 25% and 29% in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. \\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24 billion, increasing 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. \\n\\nOverall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 18% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 26% and 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services, as expected.\\n\\nIn our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 11% to over 256 million seats with impact from the continued growth trends in new business noted earlier. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by a slight decrease in new annuity contracts which carry higher in-period revenue recognition.\\n\\nEnterprise Services revenue grew 4% and 5% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions.\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly \\n\\n\\n\\n2 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 10%. Operating income grew 20% and 22% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate.\\n\\nNow to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.9 billion, decreasing 4% and 3% in constant currency, above expectations driven by better-than-expected performance in Windows partially offset by Gaming. \\n\\nWindows OEM revenue decreased 12% year-over-year, ahead of expectations due to 7 points of benefit from early back-to-school inventory builds, while the overall PC market was as expected.\\n\\nDevices revenue decreased 20% and 18% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. \\n\\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to the renewal strength noted earlier even with the moderated growth of new business in standalone offerings.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8%, a bit behind expectations due to lower ad spend noted earlier. Higher search volumes, share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser, and the benefit from the Xandr acquisition were partially offset by the impact from third party partnerships. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd in Gaming, revenue increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, lower than expected due to weakness in first-party and third-party content performance. Xbox content and services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 13%.\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars declined 2% and were relatively unchanged in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 9% and 8% in constant currency. Operating income increased 4% and 6% in constant currency.\\n\\nNow back to total company results.\\n\\nCapital expenditures including finance leases were $10.7 billion to support cloud demand, including investments in AI infrastructure. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $8.9 billion.\\n\\nCash flow from operations was $28.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Free cash flow was $19.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 22% and free cash flow increased 19%.\\n\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was $473 million, higher than anticipated driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. \\n\\n\\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 19%.\\n\\nAnd finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $38 billion for the full fiscal year.\\n\\nNow, let’s turn to next fiscal year and start with a few reminders. \\n\\nFirst, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $3.7 billion of depreciation expense shifting from FY23 to future periods. Our FY23 operating income and margins benefited from this change in accounting estimate and that will be a headwind to growth in FY24 as the benefit reduces to $2.1 billion.\\n\\nNext, my outlook commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, is on a US dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. \\n\\nAnd, my outlook does not include any impact from the Activision acquisition, which we continue to work towards closing, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. \\n\\nNow for some thoughts on the full year of FY24.\\n\\nWith the weaker US dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. The impact in H1 is expected to be greater than H2.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a total company level, revenue growth from our commercial business will continue to be driven by the Microsoft Cloud and will again outpace the growth from our consumer business. Even with strong demand and a leadership position, growth from our AI services will be gradual as Azure AI scales and our copilots reach general availability dates. So, for FY24, the impact will be weighted towards H2. \\n\\nTo support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially each quarter through the year as we scale to meet demand signals. \\n\\nWe are committed to driving operating leverage and therefore we will manage our total cost growth across COGS and operating expense in line with the demand signals we see as well as revenue growth. Increased capital spend will drive higher COGS growth than in FY23, and FY24 operating expense growth will remain low as we prioritize our spend. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year, even with the headwind from the change in accounting estimate.\\n\\nAnd finally, we expect our FY24 tax rate to be around 19%.\\n\\nNow, to the outlook for the first quarter.\\n\\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to \\n\\n\\n\\nCOGS growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth in Intelligent Cloud by 1 point with no impact to Productivity and Business Processes or More Personal Computing.\\n\\nIn commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including our renewal and upsell motions, along with long term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change headwind noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q1 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\\n\\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, as noted earlier, driven by investments in our AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. \\n\\nNext to segment guidance. \\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9 and 11% or $18 to $18.3 billion US dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. \\n\\nIn Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\\n\\nFor LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. Even with share gains in our hiring business, growth will continue to be impacted by the overall markets for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. \\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.\\n\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 15 and 16%, or 14 and 15% in constant currency. Revenue should be $23.3 to $23.6 billion US dollars.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\n\\nIn Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 25 to 26% in constant currency, including roughly 2 points from all Azure AI services. Growth continues to \\n\\n\\n\\nbe driven by our Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q4 to continue into Q1. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. \\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch.\\n\\nAnd in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be more than offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. \\n\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $12.5 to $12.9 billion US dollars. \\n\\nWindows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-teens, including 5 points of negative impact from the earlier back-to-school inventory builds that were pulled into the fourth quarter. Our guide assumes no significant changes to the PC demand environment.\\n\\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-30s due to the overall PC market and adjustments we made in our portfolio with an increased focus on our higher margin premium products.  \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid to high-single digits, roughly 5 points higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains. Growth will continue to be impacted by the advertising spend environment and third-party partnerships mentioned earlier. We continue to be excited by Bing usage signals and the longer term opportunity as we invest in AI.\\n\\nAnd in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits driven by first-party and third-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. \\n\\nNow back to company guidance.\\n\\nWe expect COGS between $16.6 to $16.8 billion US dollars and operating expense of $13.5 to $13.6 billion US dollars. Together, total cost growth should be around 6%. \\n\\nOther income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Two reminders, this does not include any impact from Activision on interest income and \\n\\n\\n\\nexpense and we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\\n\\nWe expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be around 19%. \\n\\nAnd finally, as a reminder for Q1 cash flow, we expect to make a $2.7 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA transition tax. We do not expect a payment related to the R&D capitalization provision in Q1. \\n\\nIn closing, as a company, we delivered on the FY23 financial commitments we discussed a year ago on revenue and operating margin. A focus on operational excellence allowed us to achieve these targets while we delivered near term value to customers and prioritized our investments to continue to lead in the future. As we start FY24, we are excited for the opportunities ahead, and remain focused on delivering the three key priorities Satya mentioned. We’ll maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud by helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud. We’ll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure while scaling with growing demand so we can lead the AI platform wave. And finally, we’ll align our costs with growth as we are committed to driving operating leverage.\\n\\nWith that, let’s go to Q&A, Brett. \\n\\n\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a great fiscal year. \\n\\nSatya, you started out your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What’s the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it? \\n\\nAnd then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there’s going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these, but what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions? Thank you. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value or generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For example, GitHub Copilot, in some sense, it’s sort of the no brainer to add \\n\\n\\n\\nproductivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you’re a bank, you’re a retailer or you’re a software company, it applies to everyone. That’s probably one of the things that we are seeing very good even productivity data and great adoption. \\n\\nAnd then obviously the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. First thing we sort of talked about is how we ourselves are deploying all these copilots across, whether it’s Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot, how do you get maximum value out of these horizontal toolchain? \\n\\nAnd then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, which we talked about at our developer conference called the Copilot Stack, and then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for someone like Moody’s or to build their own copilot for their people. To us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI and with speed, if you will. \\n\\nAnd so, those are the two things that we asked them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage, and then we even swarm with our own resources to help them get those things done. \\n\\nAnd the last comment I’d make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this, because I think the diffusion cycle here is, in some sense, we have a \\n\\n\\n\\nnew set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. Those would be the observations. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: And to your question, Keith, on gross margins and how I think about those, going forward, the first thing I would say is I expect gross margins here to transition over time, just like they did in the prior cloud transition. I would also say I expect workloads and the gross margins of the workloads to be different, just like they are in the cloud today. \\n\\nI would also add one thing that’s different than last time, we’ve talked a bit about this before, is that we start out in a different place with more of a shared platform, which allows us to scale those gross margins a bit faster than last time. And we do expect, as you asked and Satya talked about, the pace of this adoption curve, we do expect to be faster. You’re seeing the CapEx spend accelerate in Q4 and then again in Q1. And we’ve talked about what it should look like the rest of the year. \\n\\nNow that being said, we’re talking about all that and going through that transition while delivering in FY24 over FY23, effectively a point higher operating margins, because if it’s flat year over year, as we guided, with the headwind from the useful life change, when you correct for that, it’s about a point higher. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think the real focus here is being able to be aggressive in meeting the demand curve and focusing on the transition, and growth and gross margins, and delivering the operating leverage. \\n\\nKEITH WEISS: Excellent. Thank you, guys. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nBRENT THILL, Jeffries: Thank you. Satya, on the optimization headwinds that you continue to see, when do you think we hit peak optimization? Are we getting close to hitting that peak and getting some relief in the back half of the year and maybe AI helping provide as a tailwind? Any color from what you’re seeing from your perspective would be helpful.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Sure, Brent. Thank you for the question. Yeah, a couple of observations. One is I think overall in the cloud, you do see new project starts and then those project starts get optimized. And then you sort of time series all of that, and that’s sort of what you see in the normal course. What happened here was during the pandemic, obviously, there were lots of new projects starts and optimization, in some sense, was postponed. And that’s where you’re seeing, I’ll call it, catch up optimization. And that’s something that, to your point, we will lap going into the next couple of quarters – I think it’ll come down – and we are seeing new projects starts, \\n\\n\\n\\nboth traditional types of projects starts, even cloud migrations, data applications, and of course, obviously, the AI applications.\\n\\nBut we’ll get back to, I’ll call it, the normal pace of new project starts and optimizations, going forward. But we will cycle through, I think in the next couple of quarters, what is the last catch up optimization. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: I would just add, Brent, I think, to Satya’s point, and maybe to build a bit of a line for, I think it felt very similar to last quarter where we made the same comments, which is we’re seeing sort of the normal optimization plus we’re seeing new workload starts across these workloads Satya talked about. And I think that’s what we’re saying, going forward, and really what the change is just that lapping of, I think, a bit of a catch up from a year ago. And you’re right, we’ll continue to do that through H2. \\n\\nBRENT THILL: Thanks. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. \\n\\n\\n\\nAmy, CapEx moved up significantly Q over Q and year over year, and it’s increasing moving forward. Can you give us some color? Is it physical datacenters? Is this predominantly servers? Is it predominantly AI driven? How should we think about the useful life?\\n\\nAnd then, quickly for Satya, can you give us some status on the general availability of the full copilot development stack and how long it’s taking clients and partners to build copilots? Thanks. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: Why don’t I start on the CapEx question, Satya, then I’ll turn it over to you.\\n\\nMark, really, first of all, both in Q4 and then talking about Q1, the acceleration is really quite broad. It’s both on the datacenters and the physical basis, plus CPUs and GPUs, and networking equipment. Think of it in a broad sense as opposed to a narrow sense. It’s overall increases of acceleration of overall capacity. \\n\\nAnd I think if you look back over really FY23, you wouldn’t have seen some of the pace on normal, what I would say capacity adds, even for the normal Azure workload. You’re seeing both accelerations and normal Azure workloads plus some of the AI workloads, is partially the reason. It’s why I do comment quite often that it’s both overall commercial cloud demand and building out capacity for AI; it’s both.\\n\\n\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah, and I think, just for perspective, I think it’s sort of always good to think about it, right, where we have, what, 111 commercial cloud business growing at 22%, year over year. And then you had a CapEx growth which was around the same number, 23%-24%. In some sense, it’s sort of replacement capital plus some new capital that is going to drive new growth. That’s, I think, the scale, and we feel good about that structure of overall growth rates and how it translates into future TAM opportunity for us.\\n\\nAnd then, to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot Stack is available today on Azure. We have everything from Azure AI toolchain where you can use, obviously, Azure OpenAI, or even you can use open models from LLaMa and other Hugging Face models. You have all the Fabric and all of our operational data stores for what is one of the most useful patterns around generative AI, is what is called retrieval augmented generation, which is you take the data that you have in the data stores, use it in a prompt to generate completions, summaries, what have you. And so, that’s something that we’re seeing a lot of, and the copilots are fundamentally orchestrations of that. And so, we have all of these services available. \\n\\nWe see the thing that’s fascinating is when you use something like Power Virtual Agent, you have a low-code, no-code tool to build, effectively, these AI products or full-fledged copilots like we’ve built. And all of the \\n\\n\\n\\nunderlying primitives for that are available on Azure. The toolchain is available on Azure, and the speed with which customers are able to deploy them, ISVs are able to build them is pretty impressive. \\n\\nMARK MOERDLER: Thank you, I appreciate it.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. If I could, I just wanted to get your thoughts, shift the discussion away from COGS and CapEx to more of the top line outlook. \\n\\nIt looks like Azure growth rate is definitely starting to stabilize, and generative AI contribution to Azure is measurably improving, quarter by quarter. And optimization in a broader sense is also starting to settle down. Where does this leave with the company’s outlook for Azure growth rate in the future quarters? Are we at a point where we bottomed out, and we could start to see some acceleration due to the trends we discussed? \\n\\nAnd also, if you take the superset of Microsoft Cloud, when you throw in the new pricing for copilot, certainly looks like the TAMs are opening up in a pretty significant way. When you take that broader lens, that 21%- 22% growth rate that Satya and Amy referred to, what could be the outlook? \\n\\n\\n\\nCould we be too optimistic in entertaining hopes of some kind of acceleration in the years ahead, or how do you think about that, the outlook on the top line? Thank you so much.\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Sure, Kash. Thanks for the question. Maybe I’ll start and then, Amy, you can add because I think we do think about what’s the long-term TAM here, right? I mean, you’ve heard me talk about this as a percentage of GDP. What’s going to be tech spend? If you believe that, let’s say the 5% of GDP is going to go to 10% of GDP, maybe that gets accelerated because of the AI wave. Then the question is how much of that goes to the various parts of our commercial cloud? And then how competitive are we in each layer, right? \\n\\nIf you sort of break it down, you talked about how Microsoft 365, we think of this copilot as a third pillar, right? We had the creation tools. We then had all the communication and collaboration services, and we think the AI copilot is a third pillar. We are excited about it. Amy talked about how we want to get it out first as part of this preview, and then in the second half of the next fiscal year, we’ll start getting some of the real revenue signal from it. We’re looking forward to it, but we think of it long term as a third pillar, like we thought about something like, say, Teams or SharePoint back in the day, or what have you. \\n\\n\\n\\nThen Azure, the way I think about it is we still are, whatever, inning two or inning three of even the cloud migration, especially if you view it, right, whether by industry moves to the cloud, segment move to the cloud as well as country adoption of the cloud. There’s still early innings of the cloud migration itself. There’s a lot there still. And then on top of that, there is this completely new world of AI driving a set of new workloads. \\n\\nAnd so, we think of that, again, being pretty expansive from a TAM opportunity, and we’ll play it out. But at the same time, as we are $110- $111 billion commercial cloud that has grown in 20s. And so, therefore, we do hit law of large numbers. But that said, we do think that this is a business that can have sustained high growth, which is something that we are excited about. \\n\\nAMY HOOD: And I think the only thing, Kash, I would add is I think in some ways, what we’re really pointing to is there’s a process here. We see the demand signal is quite strong; it remains strong. I’m thrilled with all the product announcements we’ve made. I’m thrilled with them moving to preview and then moving to GA. They absolutely are expansive in terms of addressable market. They reach new budget pools, is almost the way I talk about it a lot in terms of how CIOs or CFOs that I talk to think about that investment, so a growing opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as you know, we’re focused on executing against that. And then revenue is an outcome, but it certainly does require the demand signal, requires the capital expense and then creates the opportunity. And that’s why I think in some ways, we’re spending a little more time talking about some of that investment, is because it is the demand signal. \\n\\nKASH RANGAN: Awesome. Thank you so much. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, if I could double-click a little bit on the exciting news around M365 Copilot, as everybody on the line looks to layer that opportunity into our models, I just wanted to get your views. Are there any guardrails you’d offer us to sort of keep us in line? Is there a degree of gross margin pressure in the Office segment? \\n\\nIn other words, is it a fairly cost intensive new product that we should keep in mind? And also, could it pull along Azure in the sense that you need Azure AD and perhaps some of the other cybersecurity products? A little color there might help everybody with their modeling exercise tonight and in the coming weeks.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. I think maybe I’ll first start with the process we have when we release new products. And I absolutely understand we are \\n\\n\\n\\nexcited, too, by the demand signal, the customer reaction, really the requests for getting to be in the paid preview. It’s all encouraging. \\n\\nAs you know, last week, we announced pricing. Then we’ll continue to work through the paid preview process, get good feedback. Then we’ll announce the general availability date. Then we’ll get to the GA date. Then we’ll, of course, be able to sell it and then recognize revenue. And that is why I continue to say that I am just as excited as everyone else about this, and it should be more H2 weighted. And we’ve, I think, given you some sizing opportunities and I think I would use all that. But I do think this is really about pacing. And, of course, we’ve still got to get our Security Copilot and some of the Dynamics workloads priced and released, and we’ll continue to work toward that. \\n\\nAnd, of course, I think one of the things that people often, I think, overlook is, and Satya mentioned it briefly, when you go back to the pull along Azure, I think in many ways, lots of these AI products pull along Azure because it’s not just the AI solution services that you need to build an app. And so, it’s less about Microsoft 365 pulling it along or any one copilot. It’s that when you’re building these, it requires data, and it requires the AI services. You’ll see them pull both core Azure and AI Azure along with them. And I think that’s an important nuance as well. \\n\\n\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah, and if I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the copilots. You see that today when people build applications in Teams that are built on Power Apps, and those Power Apps happen to use something like SQL DB on Azure. That’s like a classic line of business extension. You’ll see the same thing. When I have a copilot plug in, that plug in uses Azure AI, Azure meters, Azure data sources, Azure Semantic Search. You’ll see, obviously, a pull through not only on the identity or security layer, but in the core PaaS services of Azure plus the copilot extensibility in M365. \\n\\nKARL KEIRSTEAD: Terrific, thank you. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Operator, our next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nMARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, thank you very much. Satya, there’s so much evidence now that GitHub Copilot is boosting developer productivity by 40% to 50% or more, and it’s resulting in higher quality code. Do you envision a similar level of productivity boost for the Microsoft 365 Copilot or the Security Copilot, the Sales Copilot? In other words, can every room in the house be remodeled to a similar extent such that that value proposition is pretty elevated across the entire stack?\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah, Judson Althoff would love you for having used his metaphor of remodeling every room of the house with AI, because you’re \\n\\n\\n\\nabsolutely right. I mean, that’s the opportunity we see. I think what you’re also referencing is now, there is good empirical evidence and data around the GitHub Copilot and the productivity stats around it. And we’re actively working on that for M365 Copilot, also for things like the role-based ones like Sales Copilot, our Service Copilot. We see these business processes having very high productivity gains. \\n\\nAnd so, yes, over the course of the year, we will have all of that evidence. And I think at the end of the day, as Amy referenced, every CFO and CIO is also going to take a look at this. I do think for the first time, or rather, I do think people are going to look at how can they complement their OpEx spend with essentially these copilots in order to drive more efficiency and, quite frankly, even reduce the burden and drudgery of work on their OpEx and their people, and so on. Therefore, I think you’re going to see all of that translated into productivity stats, and we’re looking forward to getting that data out. \\n\\nMARK MURPHY: Thank you very much. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.) \\n\\nALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a multi-part. You mentioned a couple of times that with the AI workload adoption that you’re seeing on Azure, it’s starting to look \\n\\n\\n\\nmaybe a little bit different from an incremental share gain perspective versus previous generations. Can you maybe expand upon that? How should that drive for Azure consumption, particularly as we get through the year? \\n\\nAnd do you see a scenario where either the combination of lapping the optimization headwind plus the AI contribution plus this incremental tailwind that you’re seeing around the workloads actually does drive re-acceleration in Azure, particularly in the second half when you’re going to start to see some of those things kick in?\\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, the thing that we are both seeing and excited about is both the new workloads. I mean, if you think about Azure, we have grown Azure over the years, coming from behind. And here we are, as a strong number two in the lead when it comes to these new workloads. \\n\\nFor example, we are seeing new logos. Customers who may have used another cloud for most of what they do are, for the first time, sort of starting to use Azure for some of their new AI workloads. We also have even customers who have used multiple clouds, who’ve used us for a class of sort of workloads, also start new projects when it’s in data and AI, which they were using other clouds for. \\n\\nWhat I think you will see us is more share gains, more logo gains, reducing our TAC even. And so, those are the things, the points of leverage. But at \\n\\n\\n\\nthe same time, we are not a small business anymore in any of these things. We are of significant scale. And so, yes, we celebrate. That’s why we’re even giving you the visibility or one point of it showing up this quarter, a couple of points showing up next quarter. And those are material numbers. \\n\\nAnd so, that’s kind of what I think we’ll track. And I think Amy mentioned it because there are two parts to even the AI, right? There is the models themselves with our partnership with OpenAI. That’s sort of one type of spend on compute and the other is much more revenue driven, right, which is we will track the inference costs to the revenue and demand. And you’re already seeing both of those play out. \\n\\nALEX ZUKIN: Thank you.\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have time for one last question.\\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nKIRK MATERNE, Evercore: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. Satya, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your comments on data platforms. I think we’ve heard a lot over the last quarter or so about if you don’t have a data strategy, it’s tough to have an AI strategy. \\n\\nCan you just talk about where customers are right now in that journey to have a more, I guess, thoughtful data strategy? And what does that mean in \\n\\n\\n\\nterms of their ability to adopt AI services, meaning do they have to sort of tackle the data issue first before they can really take advantage of all the AI services, or how should we think about that sort of juxtaposition? Thanks. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question. Yes, absolutely, I think having your data, in particular in the cloud, is sort of key to how you can take advantage of essentially these new AI reasoning engines to complement, I’ll call it, your databases, because these AI engines are not databases. But they can reason over your data and to help you then get more insights, more completions, more predictions, more summaries and what have you. Those are the things, when we say copilot design pattern, that’s sort of what that design pattern is all about. \\n\\nThe thing that perhaps even in the last quarter, and I had that in my remarks, is most exciting is how, with Microsoft Fabric, especially for the analytics workloads, we’ve brought together compute, storage, governance with a very disruptive business model. \\n\\nI mean, to give you a flavor for it, right, you have your data in an Azure data lake. You can bring SQL compute to it. You can bring Spark to it. You can bring Azure AI or Azure OpenAI to it, right? The fact is you have storage separated from all these compute meters, and they’re all interchangeable, right? You don’t have to buy each of these separately. That’s the disruptive business model. \\n\\n\\n\\nI feel that Microsoft is very well positioned with the way our data architecture lays out, our business model around data, and how people will plan to use data with AI services. That’s kind of what I mean by getting your data estate in order, and it’s just not getting data estate in order, but you have to have it structured such that you can have the flexibility that allows you to exercise the data and compute in combinations that make sense for this new age. \\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kirk. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA: Thank you, all.\\n\\nAMY HOOD: Thank you, all. \\n\\n(Operator Direction.)\\n\\nEND\", metadata={'source': '..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\preprocessing\\\\DATA\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q4.docx'})]"

       " 'content': \"Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call\\n\\nBrett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood\\n\\nTuesday, October 25, 2022\\n\\nBRETT IVERSEN: \\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel.\\n\\nOn the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \\n\\nOn this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a\\xa0substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\xa0They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.\\xa0\\n\\nAll growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. \\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. \\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the \\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. \\n\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSATYA NADELLA:\\n\\nThank you, Brett.\\xa0\\n\\nTo start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times:\\xa0\\n\\nFirst, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world’s GDP will continue to increase.\\xa0\\n\\nSecond, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend, so that they can do more with less.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAnd, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant currency.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business.\\xa0\\n\\nWith that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure.\\xa0\\n\\nMoving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today.\\xa0It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints.\\xa0\\n\\nWe’re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have.\",\n",

       "('Content: And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\nNow, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. \\n\\nMy commentary, for next quarter and FY24, does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.\\n\\nNow to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue thru Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth.\\n\\nLast year we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large, multi-year commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitments to our platform as we focus on meeting customers’ changing contract needs, which include shorter-term, quick time-to-value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value. \\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. \\n\\nWe expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. \\n\\n\\n\\nNext to segment guidance. \\n\\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10 and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 to $18.2 billion US dollars.\\n\\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. \\n\\nIn Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\\n\\nFor LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digits revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.\\n\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 to $23.9 billion US dollars.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\n\\nIn Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven \\n\\n\\n\\nby our Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4 as noted earlier. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.Symbol:MSFT FiscalYear: 23 FiscalQuarter: 3 Source: ..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\preprocessing\\\\DATA\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q3.docx',)"
