    "This notebook demonstrates how we can generate a set of Questions and Answers based on chunks from a database. Documents chunked before insertion to a database and saved to `.csv` for MSFT transcripts sample. It is beneficial to generate questions and answers at this stage, as doing a search from a database has an added cost. Randomly picking chunks for specified filter parameters ensures diversity of the questions and answers. "

       "\"one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a great fiscal year. Satya, you started out your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What's the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it?  that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it? And then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there's going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these, but what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value or generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For  guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value or generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For example, GitHub Copilot, in some sense, it's sort of the no brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you're a bank, you're a retailer or you're a software company, it applies to everyone. That's probably one of the things that we are seeing very good even productivity data and great adoption. And then obviously the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. First thing we sort of talked about is how we ourselves are deploying all these copilots across, whether it's Sales Copilot or M365 \""
